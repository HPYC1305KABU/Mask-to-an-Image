In this project, we work on how to apply a mask to an image using OpenCV.

*this topic project is very useful in inpainting method.

Step 1st : First open a main file (image masking.py) and  change the selection of an image for mask.

Step 2st : Run main file in terminal for masking in an image (command) :: python image_masking.py

Step 3rd : after masking an image, then output of mask image is not ready for inpainting method. so we use Blur technique for perfect mask images.

Step 4th : open blurring_image.py for change mask image and Run last command for bluring the image mask (command) :: python blurring_image.py
